This project is in progress

In this project, I am developing a set of playlist creation tools to used with blogs and other websites. 

Spotify Playlist Creator - playlist folder

Description:
This tool uses user id to create playlists in the user's spotify account

Progress:
This tool is completed and ready for use. Please see the playlists app folder


Reddit to Playlist - reddit folder

Description:
This tool allows the user to create a playlist based on reddit music subreddits

Progress:
Not many songs posted on subreddits are from Spotify. Most are from Youtube
I am currently experimenting in multiple directions. First, I am attempting to get song information from post title using regular expression. Second, I am attempting to get song information from youtube video webpages. This requires using selenium and the youtube url from the post. Finally, I am attempting to create playlists from reddit in youtube. 

Please see my work on these experiments in the lab folder.
